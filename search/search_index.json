It has been assaulted and taken by the Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck , and then reclaimed after the Tar Ugruck were defeated by armies lead by the Paladin of Tyr named Krahan . Threats from the south, lands thought lost and inhabitable due to the time of the plague and the collapse caused by the Orcs revealed a new threat, the Vezoca-Dynasty another Human empire intent on conquering richer lands. Aggressive and driven by blind loyalty to their Emperor, its people wish to force the people of Cruidan to bow to their Dynasty, through any means possible. The-Kingdom-of-Krahan , formed in Krahan 's honour after he brought the people of Cruidan together to drive back the Tar Ugruck. Though they are still at war with the Tar Ugruck, they have spent many years rebuilding, new fortifications, the new city of Mayhearth , and many new smaller settlements. Very few buildings remain from the time before the great plague. Krahan 's Paladins-of-Tyr and Knights-of-Krahan are famous throughout the land, and yearly summer crusades are launched against the Tar Ugruck. The-League-of-Prosperity : Many of the fractured Gnome and Halfing society's, as well as many others with a mind for progress and trade, formed the League with an agreement that its Cities would remain outside of the law and government of others, and would remain neutral and peaceful, intent only on the prosperity of the land, and themselves. [[The Grey Order]] in the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society. It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of [[Eyith]], the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from Krahan have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the [[Stormy Swells]]. Magic is considered just another element of nature within the world to be harnessed like anything else. Though people who practice it are looked on with much suspicion by the general people and experimentation with magic is punishable by law. Divine magic comes from the many gods, who have their own machinations on the world, their own power is limited within this plane, instead they prefer to grant magic to their worshippers in exchange for having their will carried out, though since the great plague the gods have been silent, no word or sign besides Divine magic still working has been heard or seen. The land has become wild, the very trees and plants becoming aggressive as they fight for fertile soil, different species popping up and dying. The surviving beasts and other creatures of the land, the strong or those that have adapted, have made large areas dangerous. Even within the borders of the kingdoms there have been reports of strange beasts and animal attacks. Some laws of Krahan 1. Murder is punishable by Death by hanging. 2. Thievery is punishable by imprisonment, forced service or confiscation of all property and possessions. 3. Spreading sickness is punishable by Death by Pyre. 4. Experimentation with arcane or divine magic is punishable by Death by hanging. 5.

It has been assaulted and taken by the Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck , and then reclaimed after the Tar Ugruck were defeated by armies lead by the Paladin of Tyr named Krahan . Threats from the south, lands thought lost and inhabitable due to the time of the plague and the collapse caused by the Orcs revealed a new threat, the Vezoca-Dynasty another Human empire intent on conquering richer lands. Aggressive and driven by blind loyalty to their Emperor, its people wish to force the people of Cruidan to bow to their Dynasty, through any means possible. The-Kingdom-of-Krahan , formed in Krahan 's honour after he brought the people of Cruidan together to drive back the Tar Ugruck. Though they are still at war with the Tar Ugruck, they have spent many years rebuilding, new fortifications, the new city of Mayhearth , and many new smaller settlements. Very few buildings remain from the time before the great plague. Krahan 's Paladins-of-Tyr and Knights-of-Krahan are famous throughout the land, and yearly summer crusades are launched against the Tar Ugruck. The-League-of-Prosperity : Many of the fractured Gnome and Halfing society's, as well as many others with a mind for progress and trade, formed the League with an agreement that its Cities would remain outside of the law and government of others, and would remain neutral and peaceful, intent only on the prosperity of the land, and themselves. [[The Grey Order]] in the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society. It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of [[Eyith]], the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from Krahan have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the [[Stormy Swells]]. Magic is considered just another element of nature within the world to be harnessed like anything else. Though people who practice it are looked on with much suspicion by the general people and experimentation with magic is punishable by law. Divine magic comes from the many gods, who have their own machinations on the world, their own power is limited within this plane, instead they prefer to grant magic to their worshippers in exchange for having their will carried out, though since the great plague the gods have been silent, no word or sign besides Divine magic still working has been heard or seen. The land has become wild, the very trees and plants becoming aggressive as they fight for fertile soil, different species popping up and dying. The surviving beasts and other creatures of the land, the strong or those that have adapted, have made large areas dangerous. Even within the borders of the kingdoms there have been reports of strange beasts and animal attacks. Some laws of Krahan 1. Murder is punishable by Death by hanging. 2. Thievery is punishable by imprisonment, forced service or confiscation of all property and possessions. 3. Spreading sickness is punishable by Death by Pyre. 4. Experimentation with arcane or divine magic is punishable by Death by hanging. 5. Failure to defend the kingdom or its people is punishable by forced service. extended laws The Law of self defence states that if you can prove you were defending yourself after killing someone, that you are innocent. There are many minor laws to do with hygiene and sickness, latrines for example must be properly situated. Forced service is 1 to 5 years conscription.

Looking down you see you are dressed in fine purple clothes, lined with shimmering silver. You command the very shadows cast by the moonlight to bring you what you desire.

A suit of armour seemingly on fire \u2013 Markus and Eachan, you both transcend this plane to another realm entirely, one of fire and chaos and war, your vision becomes that of the warrior wearing this suit of armour. Horrifying fiendish creatures fall to the warriors blade but they are endless, eventually the warrior falls and the armour is cracked, your vision then follows the blood flowing from the wound and you return to back to see A shield with a real face, angry and shouting at you, but making no noise \u2013 Skorris you start to feel suffocated as you see this image, your vision blackens and you feel a great weight of earth upon you, you feel the shifting of mountains and the flow of rivers above, you body burns with pain as you feel your bones crushed, your blood pollutes the earth, but you can never die, something has bound you to this prison for eternity, somehow you know that this prison lies under the mountain of Mor Badir . Your vision then fades back A cloak made of scales of melting ice \u2013 Jurgen you are filled with the knowledge that these scales are that of a dragon. Your vision flashes for a second and you see a an ancient white dragon perched atop of a large mountain of melting ice. Within that mountain lies a horde of gold, and the bones of many elves. A white banner edged in black, stained with blood. - Shed you see other images flickering in place of the banner, a wolf howling at the moon, a sword, a shield and a spear all daubed white, strange runes dance and flicker, at first you take them for Dwarven, but they are different somehow, looking more orcish, but making no sense in either language. All of you look up except for Ozmir , above you high in the sky for as far as you can see, you see a battle taking place, the image is blurred and distorted, as though you were under water looking up. Bright flashes light up the sky silhouetting the distorted figures of the fighting creatures of all shapes and sizes. Oz your vision remains fixed on the band of silver, the shadows slowly curling around it pulling it closer and closer to your grip, the knowledge that if you fail to grasp it then everything you know will fall, for a moment you see a ship sinking at sea, a captain going down with her ship. Then you hear a voice, soft 'It is too late, he knows.. he watches..i cannot...fight him... find.... my... sister' The voice begins to fade 'too late...

Upon arriving at Winterfield we headed to the Temple to see Halward , he was expecting us and told us Lady Aliyah wanted to know when we arrived. Lady Aliyah tested the trustworthiness of the party, apart from Shed (who has the trust of her god, Tyr ), and we talked about the shared dream we have been having as a group, the Arcane Forge , Halwards prophecy, and Halwards and Lady Aliyah's dreams. We headed to the tavern afterwards to rest for the night and to consider our next move. Log \u00b6 D18: Day 6 of travel, after combat with the orcs , the shared dream \u00b6 We just fought the orcs and agreed to travel with the knights at the behest of the Royal Messenger. We set up our camp close to the knights camp The knights seem as amateurish in setting up their camp as they do at battle. Watch: Oz 20 - Eachann 23 - Shed 22 - Markus 16 Jurgen tells the sergeant about the gnolls that we fought previously. The Knight camp is split into 2 groups The Knight Commander & co, rowdier and telling tales of battle despite not really being involved in the fight. The Knight Sergeant Tren Havenhorn & co., quieter, more serious, some remorseful after they have lost comrades against the orc scouting party We eat at the knights camp Royal Messenger is flitting about both groups and comes to speak to us Royal Messenger - Sir Fared Dalan \u00b6 Claims he \"technically\" has the rank of Lord, no land but wealthy Claims he can find his way anywhere Carries his messages in a satchel Has a message for Lady Aliyah and a message for the mayor of Winterfield from Prince Jasper The messages are magically sealed (scrolls with metal wire wrapped around them) They require an enchanted ring from the King to open. serves various houses not just House Brannigan Picked up the knights with him from Fort Whitall Eachann decides to try writing a ballad about him Sir Ferro 's loot ^9467f3 \u00b6 The dagger is a fine dagger The sword seems magical (is also flavourless) The party move back to their own camp and talk about the coded letter picked up from Rhetts house, talking about his debt to something called the grin . No-one in the party has heard of them. ~~Need to ask Halward how he found out how Rhett had the map~~ Rhett was in Winterfield bragging We all have the dream for the first time. \u00b6 We rest for the night and during Shed's watch she falls asleep for what seems like just a moment and all of the party experience a shared dream , like the one Ozmir has been having. (I have excluded my handwritten notes in favour of the write up from DM). Need to ask Ozmir if his dream was the same all of the time and he omitted information when he told us about it Some aspects of shimmering orc banner images remind me of a long forgotten memory but I can't quite grasp it. Party checks about the livery of the knights Flaming sword knight - God of Tempest Bound hands knights - Knights of Ilmitar , the broken god, the ones who endures Horse/chess piece knights - Knights of the Red Oz asks Shed about Selune's sister Shar , the goddess of night We go back to sleep, with no more dreams. D19: Day 7 of travel \u00b6 Eachann plays us some ballads, day passes without incident Camp for the night -1 ration D20: Day 8 of travel, the tale of Lod, who was lost \u00b6 Skorris plays us a little of the Dwarven song, Lod's Lost The ballad of a dwarf lost in the tunnels, who carved a flute from the support beams so he could guide his brethren to him. Camp -1 ration We all have the shared dream again, same time of night during Shed's watch. D21: Day 9 of travel \u00b6 Bad breakfast A pile of charred corpses on the side of the road - orcs, looks like they've been here a while Getting out of the mountains, still a little frosty but it's starting to lift, starting to see travellers on the roads Camp, hunt, couple of rabbits We all have the dream again Oz is very upset by part of the dream, watching the ship going down every night. Oz started having the dream once we set off from Winterfield Why? Oz was forced to leave his ship & crew Eachann says he is from a simple farming village near the mountains and that he has never been in a set of armour. Eachann & Markus note that as the two humans of the group, they \"share\" a particular part of the dream. Skorris has heard secrets of things in the mountain Mor Badir , it was lost to the trolls many years ago. ^fdf6d4 Mor Badir is 1 week west of Winterfield Markus has been deciphering the notebook that we got with the map (forgot to add this to previous session notes) D22: Day 10 of travel, we arrive in Winterfield late into the night \u00b6 We see some Knights of Tyr talking to the Keepers at their tower Overhear Knight Sergeant Tren saying Lady Aliyah is still in Winterfield, has set up a HQ Couple of Keepers ask our business in town (standard practice) Dave the Keeper We head to the Temple of Selune. \u00b6 Halward goes a little pale upon seeing us There have been developments since we left Lady Aliyah is in Winterfield and has asked Halward to let her know as soon as we get back to town. Oz mentions the dream \"Odd occurence\" - Halward Halward has an assistant, a tiefling named Marphi He asks her to fetch Lady Aliyah She arrived in Winterfield a few days after we left, she has also experienced a dream. Asked Halward about how he knew Rhett had the map Rhett was in town bragging about the map over winter, he somehow managed to make it back to Copperhead despite the harsh winter weather. Halward says he seemed a good lad, if a bragger Rhett wants to be a treasure hunter Halward has been assembling a prophecy. Offers to show us his notes We receive payment for retrieving the map +100g each Lady Aliyah arrives at the temple \u00b6 Lady Aliyah arrives at the temple with two knights & Marphi She orders the knights to Secure the temple, no-one in or out and they both go outside She asks for an agreement to secrecy, nothing we discuss here must leave this temple Wishes to cast a truth spell on us and ask us each 3 questions Apart from Shed, as her god ( Tyr ) trusts Shed She will also allow us to ask her her questions under the Zone of Truth Do you wish harm on the Paladins of Tyr ? What do you know of the Crimson Grin ? Have any of you been sent here looking for someone specifically? Markus is looking for the Arcane Forge Arcane Forge may be the human name for a Dwarven thing Lady Aliyah relaxes after asking her questions of each of the party The woman and the 2 kids we saw in the wagon are ok Hunting orcs is a mask of her true purpose She is an Inquisitor There is treachery in the kingdom, even within the Paladins People are missing or even dead Oz asks what the dream has to do with anything? Halward & Aliyah have both had dreams about Shedatha Shed explains the dream the party has had to Halward and Lady A Aliyah She does not know what god the dreams could have come from She thought visions were fairytales until she had one We ask about the dreams Lady Aliyah and Halward have had Lady Aliyah's dream Shed is walking a path beset with darkness A man appears to them, blind with one hand He says that Shedatha must not fall into darkness then he sacrifices himself to save Shed Halward had a similar dream Shed was walking a twisting path with many branches, many in darkness. A woman spoke to him She tells him h must bless Shed and aid her or the world will fall into the shadow Shed must keep her faith Lady Aliyah believes that \"the darkness\" is the enemy that she seeks - \"I will find out who is responsible for my father's death\" \u00b6 Suggests that we may want to travel with her to Mayhearth Halward Shedatha may be the Champion of the moon The champion with the crown can destroy the orc threat ^cecb95 The warning about Mayhearth previously from Halward was just that if Rhett is there, it may make our job to get the map more difficult. Prince Jasper is the heir to the throne The woman in the cage is linked to The Crimson Grin named Carrie She is on the run from the grin She bears the tattoos, believes the grin are taking over as a criminal enterprise Lady Aliyah has offered her protection for information, she will be staying in WF with Halward The grin is linked to the murder of an investigator/inquisitor? LAs mother is in Mayhearth and could provide us with resources ^fa76c5 LA only wishes to aid us she must keep to her duties We told LA about Vorian & Rhetts house in Copperhead and potential links to the grin We showed the book from ferro's chest to LA She says it is not of this plane Marphi speaks infernal and her and Oz could help with translation Oz goes through what he knows so far with LA for about an hour Have care of speaking about these things in the company of others, told her about ferro and Marrik sword is a +1 sword Halward took Shed to the back of the temple and gifted her with the Gloves of the two faced goddess We head to the tavern to rest for the night and think about what we are doing next Jurgen mentioned that he had command of his unit at one point Loose Ends \u00b6 Oz started having the dream once we set off from Winterfield Why? Why did Ozmir have to leave his ship & crew? Need to ask Ozmir if his dream was the same all of the time and he omitted information when he told us about it Halward has been assembling a prophecy. Offers to show us his notes What is the champion of the moon? Why is Lady Aliyah looking into the crimson grin Was lady aliyah concerned about someone in Winterfield?
