# The Arcane Forge
The Arcane Forge is located on the north east side of the Burning Lake.

It is in a long abandoned dwarven hold, goblins live there currently.

Markus holds the artifact that allows entrance into the forge. and used it to forge a set of armour with the adamantite found in the area.


## Goblin residents
The party made frends with the goblins




The Arcane Forge is believed to be in the mountains underground, and may contain the [[Moonlit Crown]]

Arcane Forge may be the human name for a dwarven thing.


## Map to the Arcane Forge
[[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]] tasked [[The-Party|the party]] with retrieving the map and returning it to him. He believes it to be in the hands of [[Quick-Rhett|Quick Rhett]], in Copperhead, who is forming a group to seek out the treasure.

We retrieved the map from Quick Rhett's house and returned it to Halward, whilst we were travelling Markus made a copy.

There are annotations on the map in Dwarvish.

We found a notebook with the map, Markus has been working on translating it.
