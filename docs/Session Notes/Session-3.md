In-game day count: Day 6 to Day 11

## Session Summary
On the way to Copperhead we meet [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] and a band of Knights of Tyr who are hunting an orc scouting party. We make it to Copperhead, get set up in the inn and begin to ask around about Quick Ret. We learn he has a companion called [[Vorian]] who visits the inn every night. After Skorris and Shed both fail to strike up a conversation, Ozmir follows Vorian back to a house and we decide to stake it out the next day.
