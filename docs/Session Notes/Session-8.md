## Session Summary

## Log
Missed session because illness.

Notes from Alex:  
The rest of the party left the temple of Selune to head to the Confident Cow for some rest, Halword asked Shedatha to stay behind for a little while as he had some things to go over with her. This time will be spent attuning to the Gloves you received, Halword will show you how they work and complete the blessing, he will also ask Marphi to recount some of the lore behind the gloves and Selune

Marphi seems exceedingly knowledgeable about religion and history, recounting the story as if reading a book.

'It is said that Selune and Shar were one, birthed from the same Primordial essence. The goddesses were beautiful, identical but polar opposites, raven-haired and silver-haired, one representing the dark, the other the light. Yet they were so close they saw themselves as one being, known later as the Two-Faced Goddess or the Sisters-Who-Were-One. They complemented each other and brought order out of the chaos.' 'Together, they created from the cosmic ether and the other heavenly bodies and infused these worlds with life. In the process, they formed the goddess Chauntea, whom they worked with to bless the worlds with life.'

'This universe was darkened by the hair and welcoming embrace of Shar and illuminated by the cool radiant face of Selûne. However, there was no fire or heat on any of these bodies. Desiring to nurture life on the worlds that formed her body and limbs, Chauntea asked the Two-Faced Goddess for warmth. Then, for the first time, Shar and Selûne were divided, being of two minds on whether they should let there be more life on the worlds or not' 'The two goddesses then fought over the fate of their creations. From the residues of these struggles emerged the original deities of magic, war, disease, murder, death, and others. Seizing an advantage, Selûne reached out of the universe altogether and into a plane of fire and, though it burned her painfully, brought forth a fragment of ever-living flame. She ignited a heavenly body the Sun in order to give warmth to Chauntea' 

After around half an hour of the others leaving, they came rushing back, bursting into the temple and asking if you were alright, Lady Aliyah had also returned with them. Claims of masked figures attacking them in the night, worries that you were the target.

After things calmed down you all decided to head back to the Confident Cow to finally get a nights rest, Though Lady Aliyah tells you she has a few more things to discuss tomorrow.
