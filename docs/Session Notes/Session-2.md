# Session 2 - Gnoll attack, and the fate of [[Sir-Ferro-of-House-Galawin|Sir Ferro]]
Date of session: 2022-02-02  
In-game day count: Day 4 to Day 5

## Session Summary
The party follows the tracks from the road to the gnoll camp and attacks, killing all but one of the gnolls and rescuing [[Squire-Marrik|Squire Marrik of House Galawin]]. The next day travelling Markus spots sign of a struggle off the road, and we find the dead body of [[Sir-Ferro-of-House-Galawin|Sir Ferro of House Galawin]] not far away. After looting his corpse and unceremoniously transporting the body back to the road, we bury the body and continue on our way. We are able to open the chest and find a magic book and some gemstones inside.
