## Session Summary

## Log
Note from Joe's recap
Lady Zilyana, near Brightwoods

Note: We have 6 horses, 1 mule & 1 cart. 6 party members & 1 guest.

Breakfast after camp

Heading into the burning lake
valley between mountains
very craggy, shimmery lake  

On the mountains high up, skull totem
	Hamdec "There was a road through this valley before the war with the orcs, great magics were unleashed here. These mountains are very dangerous, as much as the Underdark. It is said that the plague still lurks here"

The yellow x on the map the the AF possibly marks a safe haven, home or outpost.
We are struggling to interpret the map

It is slow going and we camp again after plotting our route to the safe haven
The ground has never reaclaimed the bones
Hamdec "Lake water is undrinkable, may kill you"

* Shed asleep* Skorris hears a rumble under the ground, but decided nto to share that with anyone

Good breakfast

Come down into valley, more tree & plants
oily water with a giant set of bones and a giant skull. Skorris splashes in the water and two gray oozes appear!
COMBAT
2 more appear
Skorris salts the gray ooze, the attack is ineffective

- Radiant Sun bolt has no to hit on Foundry +dex+proficiency bonus

Oozes damage weapons that hit them and damage armour when attacking people

+ 2 more oozes
+ + more oozes
Eachann needs cuttign words compendium macros

We take out enough oozes to safely get away on our horses

Crossroads at the ? on the map
Oz & Ham start setting up the camp
Each & Shed scout West
Skorris & Markus scout NE

WEST land more batten, bones, another goblin effigy.
some tracks around, a more well trod path

NE pillar & archway jutting out og some rocks.
path goes into the mountain, another pillar with a dwarven mark

WEST feel a large thud in the earth, some rocks tumble down the hill a louf roar from down tin the valley. echoing we head back as the sun starts to set

NE they head into an open cavernm they see a samaged bridge

WEST we made it back to the camp, oxz and hamdec didnt hear the roar, maybe trolls eachann is spooked

NE skorris falls down a crevasses, stops his fall with his pickaxe and markus pulls him up

when they return to camp they tell us about giant spiders a broke n bridge dwarven stymbol windigo goblin babies, creepy voicesm save me tiny footprints big cobwebs
