# Session 7 - Back in Winterfield, the plot thickens
Date of session: 2022-04-13  
In-game day count: Day 18 to Day 22   

## Session Summary
We travelled back into Winterfield with the knights & the Royal Messenger, and started to all have [[The-Partys-Shared-Dream|a shared dream]] each night. Upon arriving at Winterfield we headed to the Temple to see [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]], he was expecting us and told us [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] wanted to know when we arrived.  
[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] tested the trustworthiness of the party, apart from Shed (who has the trust of her god, [[Tyr]]), and we talked about [[The-Partys-Shared-Dream|the shared dream]] we have been having as a group, [[The-Arcane-Forge|the Arcane Forge]], Halwards prophecy, and Halwards and Lady Aliyah's dreams.  
We headed to the tavern afterwards to rest for the night and to consider our next move.

## Log
##### D18: Day 6 of travel, after combat with the orcs , the shared dream 
We just fought the orcs and agreed to travel with the knights at the behest of the Royal Messenger.

- We set up our camp close to the knights camp
	- The knights seem as amateurish in setting up their camp as they do at battle.
- Watch: Oz 20 - Eachann 23 - Shed 22 - Markus 16
- Jurgen tells the [[Knight-Sergeant-Tren-Havenhorn|sergeant]] about the gnolls that we fought previously.
	- The Knight camp is split into 2 groups
		- The [[Knight Commander]] & co, rowdier and telling tales of battle despite not really being involved in the fight.
		- The [[Knight-Sergeant-Tren-Havenhorn|Knight Sergeant Tren Havenhorn]] & co., quieter, more serious, some remorseful after they have lost comrades against the orc scouting party
- We eat at the knights camp
	- Royal Messenger is flitting about both groups and comes to speak to us

###### Royal Messenger - Sir Fared Dalan
- Claims he "technically" has the rank of Lord, no land but wealthy
- Claims he can find his way anywhere
- Carries his messages in a satchel
	- Has a message for [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]]
	- and a message for the mayor of Winterfield from Prince Jasper
		- The messages are magically sealed (scrolls with metal wire wrapped around them)
		- They require an enchanted ring from the King to open.
- serves various houses not just House Brannigan
- Picked up the knights with him from Fort Whitall
- [[Eachann]] decides to try writing a ballad about him

######  [[Sir-Ferro-of-House-Galawin|Sir Ferro]]'s loot ^9467f3
- The dagger is a fine dagger
- The sword seems magical (is also flavourless)

The party move back to their own camp and talk about the [[Coded Letter for Quick Rhett|coded letter]] picked up from Rhetts house, talking about his debt to something called [[The-Crimson-Grin|the grin]].

- No-one in the party has heard of them.
- ~~Need to ask [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]] how he found out how [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] had the map~~
	- Rhett was in Winterfield bragging

###### We all have the dream for the first time.
We rest for the night and during Shed's watch she falls asleep for what seems like just a moment and all of the party experience [[The-Partys-Shared-Dream|a shared dream]], like the one Ozmir has been having.
(I have excluded my handwritten notes in favour of the write up from DM). 

- Need to ask Ozmir if his dream was the same all of the time and he omitted information when he told us about it
- Some aspects of shimmering orc banner images remind me of a long forgotten memory but I can't quite grasp it.

Party checks about the livery of the knights

- Flaming sword knight - God of Tempest
- Bound hands knights - [[Knights-of-Ilmatar|Knights of Ilmitar]], the broken god, the ones who endures
- Horse/chess piece knights - [[Knights-of-the-red|Knights of the Red]]

Oz asks Shed about Selune's sister

- [[Shar]], the goddess of night

We go back to sleep, with no more dreams.

##### D19: Day 7 of travel
- Eachann plays us some ballads, day passes without incident
- Camp for the night -1 ration

##### D20: Day 8 of travel, the tale of Lod, who was lost
- Skorris plays us a little of the Dwarven song, [[Lods-Lost|Lod's Lost]]
	- The ballad of a dwarf lost in the tunnels, who carved a flute from the support beams so he could guide his brethren to him.
- Camp -1 ration
	- We all have [[The-Partys-Shared-Dream|the shared dream]] again, same time of night during Shed's watch.

##### D21: Day 9 of travel
- Bad breakfast
- A pile of charred corpses on the side of the road - orcs, looks like they've been here a while
- Getting out of the mountains, still a little frosty but it's starting to lift, starting to see travellers on the roads
- Camp, hunt, couple of rabbits

- We all have the dream again
	- Oz is very upset by part of the dream, watching the ship going down every night.
		- Oz started having the dream once we set off from Winterfield
			- Why?
		- Oz was forced to leave his ship & crew
- Eachann says he is from a simple farming village near the mountains and that he has never been in a set of armour.
- Eachann & Markus note that as the two humans of the group, they "share" a particular part of the dream.
- Skorris has heard secrets of things in the mountain [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]], it was lost to the trolls many years ago. ^fdf6d4
	- [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]] is 1 week west of Winterfield
	- Markus has been deciphering the notebook that we got with the map (forgot to add this to previous session notes)

###### [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] arrives at the temple
[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] arrives at the temple with two knights & [[Marphi]]  

- She orders the knights to Secure the temple, no-one in or out and they both go outside
- She asks for an agreement to secrecy, nothing we discuss here must leave this temple
	- Wishes to cast a truth spell on us and ask us each 3 questions
		- Apart from Shed, as her god ([[Tyr]]) trusts Shed
		- She will also allow us to ask her her questions under the Zone of Truth  
1.  Do you wish harm on the [[Paladins-of-Tyr|Paladins of Tyr]]?
2. What do you know of [[The-Crimson-Grin|the Crimson Grin]]?
3. Have any of you been sent here looking for someone specifically?
	- Markus is looking for [[The-Arcane-Forge|the Arcane Forge]]
	- [[The-Arcane-Forge|Arcane Forge]] may be the human name for a Dwarven thing

Lady Aliyah relaxes after asking her questions of each of the party

- The woman and the 2 kids we saw in the wagon are ok
- Hunting orcs is a mask of her true purpose
	- She is an Inquisitor
- There is treachery in the kingdom, even within the [[Paladins-of-Tyr|Paladins]]
	- People are missing or even dead

Oz asks what the dream has to do with anything?  
Halward & Aliyah have both had dreams about Shedatha  
Shed explains the dream the party has had to Halward and Lady A

Aliyah

- She does not know what god the dreams could have come from
- She thought visions were fairytales until she had one

We ask about [[Aliyah-and-halwards-dream|the dreams Lady Aliyah and Halward]] have had  
Lady Aliyah's dream

- Shed is walking a path beset with darkness
- A man appears to them, blind with one hand
	- He says that Shedatha must not fall into darkness
	- then he sacrifices himself to save Shed

Halward had a similar dream

- Shed was walking a twisting path with many branches, many in darkness.
- A woman spoke to him
- She tells him h must bless Shed and aid her or the world will fall into the shadow
- Shed must keep her faith

[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] believes that "the darkness" is the enemy that she seeks

- "I will find out who is responsible for my father's death"
- 
Suggests that we may want to travel with her to Mayhearth

Halward

- Shedatha may be the [[Champion of the moon]]
- The champion with the crown can destroy the orc threat ^cecb95

The warning about Mayhearth previously from Halward was just that if [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] is there, it may make our job to get the map more difficult.

- Prince Jasper is the heir to the throne ^2e28a4
- The woman in the cage is linked to [[The-Crimson-Grin|The Crimson Grin]]
	- named [[Kari]]
	- She is on the run from [[The-Crimson-Grin|the grin]]
	- She bears the tattoos, believes [[The-Crimson-Grin|the grin]] are taking over as a criminal enterprise
	- Lady Aliyah has offered her protection for information, she will be staying in WF with Halward
	- [[The-Crimson-Grin|The grin]] is linked to the murder of an investigator/inquisitor?
- LAs mother is in Mayhearth and could provide us with resources ^fa76c5
- LA only wishes to aid us
	- she must keep to her duties
- We told LA about Vorian & Rhetts house in Copperhead and potential links to [[The-Crimson-Grin|the grin]]
- We showed the book from ferro's chest to LA
	- She says it is not of this plane
	- [[Marphi]] speaks infernal and her and Oz could help with translation
	- Oz goes through what he knows so far with LA for about an hour
- Have care of speaking about these things in the company of others,
- told her about ferro and Marrik
- sword is a +1 sword

Halward took Shed to the back of the temple and gifted her with the [[Gloves of the two faced goddess]]

We head to the tavern to rest for the night and think about what we are doing next

- Jurgen mentioned that he had command of his unit at one point
