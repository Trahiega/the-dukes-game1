# Session 7
Date of session: 2022-04-13  
In-game day count: Day 18 to Day 22   

## Session Summary
We travelled back into Winterfield with the knights & the Royal Messenger, and started to all have [[The Dream]] each night. Upon arriving at Winterfield we headed to the Temple to see [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]], he was expecting us and told us [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] wanted to know when we arrived. [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] tested the trustworthiness of the party, apart from Shed (who has the trust of her god, [[Tyr]]), and we talked about [[The Dream]] we had been having as a group, the Arcane Forge, Halwards prophecy and Halwards and Lady A's dreams.  
We headed to the tavern afterwards to rest for the night and to consider our next move.

## Log
##### D18: Day 6 of travel, after combat with the orcs , the shared dream 
We just fought the orcs and agreed to travel with the knights at the behest of the Royal Messenger.

- We set up our camp close to the knights camp
	- The knights seem as amateurish in setting up their camp as they do at battle.
- Watch: Oz 20 - Eachann 23 - Shed 22 - Markus 16
- Jurgen tells the [[Knight-Sergeant-Tren-Havenhorn|sergeant]] about the gnolls that we fought previously.
	- The Knight camp is split into 2 groups
		- The [[Knight Commander]] & co, rowdier and telling tales of battle despite not really being involved in the fight.
		- The [[Knight-Sergeant-Tren-Havenhorn|Knight Sergeant Tren Havenhorn]] & co., quieter, more serious, some remorseful after they have lost comrades against the orc scouting party
- We eat at the knights camp
	- Royal Messenger is flitting about both groups and comes to speak to us

###### Royal Messenger - Sir Fared Dalan
- Claims he "technically" has the rank of Lord, no land but wealthy
- Claims he can find his way anywhere
- Carries his messages in a satchel
	- Has a message for [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]]
	- and a message for the mayor of Winterfield from Prince Jasper
		- The messages are magically sealed (scrolls with metal wire wrapped around them)
		- They require an enchanted ring from the King to open.
- serves various houses not just House Brannigan
- Picked up the knights with him from Fort Whitall
- [[Eachann]] decides to try writing a ballad about him

[[Sir-Ferro-of-House-Galawin|Sir Ferro]]'s loot ^9467f3
	- The dagger is a fine dagger
	- The sword seems magical (is also flavourless)

The party move back to their own camp and talk about the [[Coded Letter for Quick Rhett|coded letter]] picked up from Rhetts house, talking about his debt to something called [[The-Crimson-Grin|the grin]].
- No-one in the party has heard of them.
- ~~Need to ask [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]] how he found out how [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] had the map~~
	- Rhett was in Winterfield bragging

We rest for the night and during Shed's watch she falls asleep for what seems like just a moment and all of the party experience [[The Dream|a shared dream]], like the one Ozmir has been having.
(I have excluded my handwritten notes in favour of the write up from DM). 
- Need to ask Ozmir if his dream was the same all of the time and he omitted information when he told us about it
- Some aspects of shimmering orc banner images remind me of a long forgotten memory but I can't quite grasp it.

Party checks about the livery of the knights
- Flaming sword knight - God of Tempest
- Bound hands knights - [[Knights-of-Ilmatar|Knights of Ilmitar]], the broken god, the ones who endures
- Horse/chess piece knights - Knights of the red

We go back to sleep, with no more dreams.

###### [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] arrives at the temple
[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] arrives at the temple with two knights & [[Marphi]]  
- She orders the knights to Secure the temple, no-one in or out and they both go outside
- She asks for an agreement to secrecy, nothing we discuss here must leave this temple
	- Wishes to cast a truth spell on us and ask us each 3 questions
		- Apart from Shed, as her god ([[Tyr]]) trusts Shed
		- She will also allow us to ask her her questions under the Zone of Truth  
1.  Do you wish harm on the [[Paladins-of-Tyr|Paladins of Tyr]]?
2. What do you know of [[The-Crimson-Grin|the Crimson Grin]]?
3. Have any of you been sent here looking for someone specifically?
	- Markus is looking for the Arcane Forge
	- Arcane Forge may be the human name for a Dwarven thing

- The woman and the 2 kids we saw in the wagon are ok
- Hunting orcs is a mask of her true purpose
	- She is an Inquisitor
- There is treachery in the kingdom, even within the [[Paladins-of-Tyr|Paladins]]
	- People are missing or even dead

Oz asks what the dream has to do with anything?
Halward & Aliyah have both had dreams about Shedatha
- Shed explains the dream the party has had to Halwardand Lady A

Aliyah
- She does nto know what god the dreams could have come from
- She thought visions were fairytales until she had one

We ask about [[the dream]] Halwardnad Lady Aliyahhave had
- Shed is walking a path beset with darkness
- A man appears to them, blind with one hand
	- He says that Shedatha must not fall into darkness
	- then he sacrifices himself to save Shed
- Halward had a similar dream
	- Shed was walking a twisting path with many branches, many in darkness.
	- A woman spoke to him
	- She tells him h must bless Shed and aid her or the world will fall into the shadow
	- Shed must keep her faith

[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] believes that "the darkness" is the enemy that she seeks
- "I will find out who is responsible for my father's death"
Suggests that we may want to travel with her to Mayhearth

Halward
- Shedatha may be the champion of the moon
- The champion with the crown can destroy the orc threat

The warning about Mayhearth previously from Halward was just that if [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] is there, it may make our job to get the map more difficult.
