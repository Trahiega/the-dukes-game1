In-game day count: Day 

## Session Summary
After the party has a brush with assassin's, we rested at the tavern for the night. We heading back to the temple to get some more information from [[Lady-Aliyah]] & [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]], did some shopping for supplies and sold up our goods. Then stopping off to meet with the captured orc for a brief conversation, we left Winterfield and headed to Tyr's Hollow.

At Tyr's Hollow we met up with the dwarf [[Hamdec Coalguard]] who agreed to aid in guiding us through the underground passes around [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]]. We set out from Tyr's Hollow and headed south, into the mountain pass north of the burning lake, intending to follow the [[Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge]] and see what we uncover.

## Log
Note: The assassins had tattoos of [[The-Crimson-Grin|The Crimson Grin]].

##### At the Winterfield Tavern
We slept at the inn with no dreams, no visions
Looking around at breakfast we note a bard in the tavern (with a lute), also a [[League Gnome|gnome]].

Skorris mentions [[Tyr's Hollow]]
- There is a dwarf there he should speak to, knows his way underground, to [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]]
- [[Hamdec Coalguard]] from Khaz Gurum, left the [[Dwarven Empire|dwarf empire]] years ago

We plan to head and see the dwarf before heading to [[The Burning Lake]], following the [[Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge]]

##### Shopping with the gnomish travelling merchant[]()
[[GnomeIThe gnome from the tavern]](?) is a travelling merchant with some magical goods for sale.  
- Oz bought Fire Wine
- Eachann got a cloak of dramatic Entrance
	- Dwarven Moss moment
	- (note Eachann's instrument is called a yarting)
- He also sold a bag that you pull animals from?
The great ink haggling (Eachann and Markus)

##### Meeting at the Temple
We head to the temple to meet [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] and [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]].  
LA asked [[Kari]] about the assassins, [[Kari]] was worried they were after her. Note: One of the assassins escaped from the party's pursuit.  
The message LA received from [[Prince Jasper]] requested her aid, Orcs are invading Krahan but the army of krahan is protecting the interior. PJ is building a small force from various places in the area to help defend Krahan.  
LA will be heading to Mayhearth to join Prince Jasper.  

LA ponders about the darkness she seeks, the other threat to the land - what is it? But for now, the Orc threat takes precedent. The Orcs have a fleet, and likely will be landing south between mountains and the sea.

**Lady Aliyah's Mother**  
LA mentions her mother again, [[Countess Zilyana Thenan]], an elf, a polictician. She may help us but LA advsies we shouldn't trust her implicitly.

**The captured Orc**  
We can speak to the captured orc if we wish, he has given LA nothing.

LA believes most of the orcs in the area have been defeated but be should still be wary.

**Regarding Dreams**  
Asked about the dreams. LA's dreams started after meeting us on the road, Hal's dreams maybe started around the same time.

**About the book**
No more has been discerned of the book, it has a presence of evil and LA advises us to be careful with it, don't use it.
- We plan to leave the book and the gemstones in Winterfield in the care of Halward & Marphi  

**Other questions & answers**  
- When LA asked if we were looking for someone, she was thinking of [[Kari]], but the questions were more for a test of character.  
- An inquisitor is someone who roots out traitors, a secretive sect of the [[Paladins-of-Tyr|Paladins of Tyr]]  
- The message for the mayor was potentially about raising troops for PJ ^e7ae1d
- When Hal mentioned developments he was referring to LAs arrival and the dreams
- Hal doesn't know how Rhett travelled to [[Copperhead]]
- Hal's notes on the prophecy about champion of the moon
	- **Need to ask alex for the short notes given to Shed by Halward**

We are advised to be wary of dwarves, as they have a tenuous relationship with the Kingdom of Krahan.

LA offers us some horses to aid our travel.
+4 horses from LA

##### To-do list
- [x] need to sell up the loot on the cart
- [x] going to talk to the captured orc (note: he surrended to LA's Paladins)

**+1418 party gold** from gear on the cart that we sold

##### Conversation with the captured Orc
Shed, Markus and Eachann head to LAs HQ to talk to the captured orc.

**[[Mulrah the Seeker]]**  
Description: older greying hair, yellow eyes, manacled, bruised, cuts

- He doesn't trust me, and definitely doesn't trust humans.
- His orcish sounds different to mine, his is more flowery, mine is more guttural.
- The humans were granted this land (Krahan) by the elves and the dwarves
- The orcs worship mother nature now, but a long time ago they worshipped [[Selûne]]
- He is a diplomat of sorts, his mission to find allies in the mountains, in the half orcs
- He mentions Tar Ugruck - who was he?
	- long before [[Krahan]]
	- He broke away the orcs away from elvish tyranny
- The Orcs were slaves to elves and dwarves

##### Journey to Tyr's Hollow
We head to [[Tyr's Hollow]]
1 night of camp, hunted 1 deer, Skorris made a good meal
+1 deer skin to party inventory

##### Arrival at Tyr's Hollow
[[Tyr's Hollow]] sits below the [[Temple of Selune]] in the west of the [[The-Kingdom-of-Krahan|The Kingdom of Krahan]]  

- There is a celebration happening
- The town is not really defended, the guards are not stopping people heading in to the town
- I looked for a monk whilst we were in Tyr's Hollow, but did not see any that I recognise.

##### Meeting the dwarf
- We go looking for the dwarf [[Hamdec Coalguard]]
	- He has a shack north of town, fairly isolated, well tended if a little run down
- [x] ask alex for pic of the dwarf
- Skorris goes up to the door to talk to him, he is very suspicious of outsiders, but allows Skorris in and talks to him.
- Hamdec agrees to travel with us, he will be able to guide us through the tunnels under the mountains
- **Fee agreed at 8g per day**

We stay at the inn overnight & join in the festivities. Eachann screws up his first performance roll, but manages to pick it up on the second performing "Lankirk's Folly", and "I incite a riot"

No dreams at night

##### Leaving Tyr's Hollow, heading into the mountain pass
- Markus went to the post office to send a letter
- We head into the mountains pass towards the burning lake
- There are mounds covered in vines, an ancient battlefield from around the time of the plague

We have done 1 day travel and are about half way through the pass.
