# Session-6
Date of session: 2022-01-19  
In-game day count: Day 15 to Day 17  

## Session Summary
Travelling through [[Bandits-Way|Bandit's Way]] the party comes across the corpse of an orc hanging from a tree and several freshly dug graves. Several days into our journey we hear a fight up ahead of us, the group of knights we saw a few days ago have been ambushed by some orcs. We join the fight and help to push the orcs into a retreat. The knights are escorting a [[Sir Fared Dalan Royal Messenger]] who has a message for [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]], he offers us payment to join their band on the way to Winterfield so we accept.
