## Session Summary
Second day in Copperhead, Ozmir awakes having had a strange dream in the night. Shedatha goes around town to try to find more information whilst the rest of the party seeks information on [[Quick-Rhett|Quick Rhett]]. Skorris gets into a fight with [[Randall]] after following him from [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]]'s house to the tavern.
