We decide to forget the bridge and climb over the rocks to the north we find a rope that looks like it hasn't been here that long. Made it around to the other side of the bridge we ventured deeper red dwarf and many things in the tunnel we got left we found the goblin effigy where is the creepy scarecrow that appears intruders leave or creatures hiding in the start skagra collapses into combat your three goblins that immediately run from us they seem fearful of more than us to run through a tunnel and cut through the stone let's get some poison arrows from one of their corpses we had through the goblin tunnel or bones of humans wars or some dragon statues minecart tunnel and a dwarven hold padded equipment or a blunted stoke by a door Matt suggested could be keeping a pet in this room the door is barred from this side scaris says goblin spider riders short rest in a side room that was locked or pick large markets covered a lot of all gold own put it into some magical vibe it seemed to just take everything in is it glowing mushroom cave where we picked up a shiny ring from a skeleton I believe Marcus has this now goblin seemed to be farming the mushrooms doors ahead goblin hunts around hundreds of ice looking gathers goblins come out and talk to us intruders get out they don't go into the dark dead things in there that move as officer fire wine to the goblin he recognises it and says that a small human traits with them this must be the name leave now trade or die no song sounds like dead things I gave him the poisonous apps I had we asked for information and passage to the dead things we head into the goblin town there were hundreds of them many weapons but they all look scared at our presence?
