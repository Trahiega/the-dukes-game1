## Session Summary

## Log
Note: The assassins had tattoos of [[The-Crimson-Grin|The Crimson Grin]].

###### At the Winterfield Tavern
We slept at the inn with no dreams, no visions
Looking around at breakfast we note a bard in the tavern (with a lute), also a gnome.

Skorris mentions [[Tyr's Hollow]]
- There is a dwarf there he should speak to, knows his way underground, to [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]]
- [[Hamdec Coalguard]] from Khaz Gurum, left the [[Dwarven Empire|dwarf empire]] years ago

We plan to head and see the dwarf before heading to [[The Burning Lake]], following the [[Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge]]

##### Shopping with the gnomish travelling merchant
[[League Gnome|The gnome from the tavern]](?) is a travelling merchant with some magical goods for sale.  
- Oz bought Fire Wine
- Eachann got a cloak of dramatic Entrance
	- Dwarven Moss moment
	- (note Eachann's instrument is called a yarting)
- He also sold a bag that you pull animals from?
The great ink haggling (Eachann and Markus)

##### Meeting at the Temple
We head to the temple to meet [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] and [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]].  
LA asked [[Carrie]] about the assassins, [[Carrie]] was worried they were after her. Note: One of the assassins escaped from the party's pursuit.  
The message LA received from [[Prince Jasper]] requested her aid, Orcs are invading Krahan but the army of krahan is protecting the interior. PJ is building a small force from various places in the area to help defend Krahan.  
LA will be heading to Mayhearth to join Prince Jasper.  

LA ponders about the darkness she seeks, the other threat to the land - what is it? But for now, the Orc threat takes precedent. The Orcs have a fleet, and likely will be landing south between mountains and the sea.

**Lady Aliyah's Mother**  
LA mentions her mother again, [[Countess Zilyana Thenan]], an elf, a polictician. She may help us but LA advsies we shouldn't trust her implicitly.

**The captured Orc**  
We can speak to the captured orc if we wish, he has given LA nothing.

LA believes most of the orcs in the area have been defeated but be should still be wary.

**Regarding Dreams**  
Asked about the dreams. LA's dreams started after meeting us on the road, Hal's dreams maybe started around the same time.

**About the book**
No more has been discerned of the book, it has a presence of evil and LA advises us to be careful with it, don't use it.
- We plan to leave the book and the gemstones in Winterfield in the care of Halward & Marphi
