## Log
###### D1 Party meets in the Temple of Selune in Winterfield to speak to the priest.
- Halward, late 40s, balding, friendly
- **100g** each to retrieve the map to the Arcane Forge (in the mountains underground), an item of great value to the Temple of Selune was lost there.
	- The Moonlit Crown
	- "When it is restored to it's rightful place, Selune's glory will be restored to the world" - *Did Halward say this? I don't remember*
- Quick Ret has acquired the map and has been forming a group to go out and seek the treasure.
	- Home in Copperhead
	- Halward describes Ret as a short human, and a boastful thief.
	- Ret has a friend in the Thieves' Guild
- Warnings from Halward
	- Beware the Thieves' Guild
	- Beware heading to Mayhearth

###### Routes to Copperhead
1. Through Bandit's Way, about 2 weeks travel.
2. The King's Road through the mountains (Krahan's grave*(sp?)* fortress)
3. Round the mountain
4. Under the mountain, about a month

- Skorris strongly insists he can lead us under the mountain.
- We decide to go with 1. Through Bandit's Way and the party splits to rest up for the night, to meet back at the temple in the morning.
