# Sel没ne, Goddess of the moon
Sister is [[Shar]], the goddess of night.

### Lore from [[Marphi]] in [[Session-8|Session 8]].
'It is said that Selune and Shar were one, birthed from the same Primordial essence. The goddesses were beautiful, identical but polar opposites, raven-haired and silver-haired, one representing the dark, the other the light. Yet they were so close they saw themselves as one being, known later as the Two-Faced Goddess or the Sisters-Who-Were-One. They complemented each other and brought order out of the chaos.' 

'Together, they created from the cosmic ether and the other heavenly bodies and infused these worlds with life. In the process, they formed the goddess [[Chauntea]], whom they worked with to bless the worlds with life.'

'This universe was darkened by the hair and welcoming embrace of Shar and illuminated by the cool radiant face of Sel没ne. However, there was no fire or heat on any of these bodies. Desiring to nurture life on the worlds that formed her body and limbs, Chauntea asked the Two-Faced Goddess for warmth. Then, for the first time, Shar and Sel没ne were divided, being of two minds on whether they should let there be more life on the worlds or not' 

'The two goddesses then fought over the fate of their creations. From the residues of these struggles emerged the original deities of magic, war, disease, murder, death, and others. Seizing an advantage, Sel没ne reached out of the universe altogether and into a plane of fire and, though it burned her painfully, brought forth a fragment of ever-living flame. She ignited a heavenly body the Sun in order to give warmth to Chauntea'
