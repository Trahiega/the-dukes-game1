# Coded Letter for Quick Rhett
You are to do as my two associates say, you owe us [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]]

[[The-Crimson-Grin|The Grin]] does not forget or forgive.

Do not make us visit the red smile upon you or anyone else in your name.

You may be quick but we have ways of finding you, remember that.

I leave how you acquire the payment for your debt up to you and my two associates.

C.G.
