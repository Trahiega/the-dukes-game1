# The  Party's Shared Dream
Whoever is on watch will experience the dream over a few seconds

You are awoken for your watch, you find a comfortable spot and stare off into the night, looking and listening for danger, after a while, all of a sudden your eye lids start to droop, your head lols to the side as for a moment you fall asleep, in that moment you experience a vivid dream before snapping awake.

The dream is the same yet different to your previous dreams Oz, you feel the presence of each other in this shared dream, yet you are one being.

You are hurtling through the night sky towards the land, you know this land to be [[Cruidan]] but somehow changed, vastly different from any map you know. If this is past or future, or just some mad vision like dream you are unsure.

The land bursts and breaks sending up showers of earth and trees as you impact

You all feel strong as you emerge from the crater, you feel power unlike anything you have felt before coursing through your body and mind. Looking down you see you are dressed in fine purple clothes, lined with shimmering silver. 

You command the very shadows cast by the moonlight to bring you what you desire. They squirm and twist to your will, and in front of you appear several images, the shadows wrap themselves around each image and attempt to pull them into your grasp, but it is not enough, the images are

A band of silver etched with the phases of the moon – The shadows grip this image the hardest, curling and straining around it, pulling it ever so slowly into your grasp.

A suit of armour seemingly on fire – [[Markus]] and [[Eachann]], you both transcend this plane to another realm entirely, one of fire and chaos and war, your vision becomes that of the warrior wearing this suit of armour. Horrifying fiendish creatures fall to the warriors blade but they are endless, eventually the warrior falls and the armour is cracked, your vision then follows the blood flowing from the wound and you return to back to see

A shield with a real face, angry and shouting at you, but making no noise – Skorris you start to feel suffocated as you see this image, your vision blackens and you feel a great weight of earth upon you, you feel the shifting of mountains and the flow of rivers above, you body burns with pain as you feel your bones crushed, your blood pollutes the earth, but you can never die, something has bound you to this prison for eternity, somehow you know that this prison lies under the mountain of [[Mor-Badir|Mor Badir]]. Your vision then fades back

A cloak made of scales of melting ice – [[Jurgen]] you are filled with the knowledge that these scales are that of a dragon. Your vision flashes for a second and you see a an ancient white dragon perched atop of a large mountain of melting ice. Within that mountain lies a horde of gold, and the bones of many elves.

A white banner edged in black, stained with blood. - [[Shedatha|Shed]] you see other images flickering in place of the banner, a wolf howling at the moon, a sword, a shield and a spear all  daubed white, strange runes dance and flicker, at first you take them for Dwarven, but they are different somehow, looking more orcish, but making no sense in either language.

All of you look up except for [[Ozmir]], above you high in the sky for as far as you can see, you see a battle taking place, the image is blurred and distorted, as though you were under water looking up. Bright flashes light up the sky silhouetting the distorted figures of the fighting creatures of all shapes and sizes.

Oz your vision remains fixed on the band of silver, the shadows slowly curling around it pulling it closer and closer to your grip, the knowledge that if you fail to grasp it then everything you know will fall, for a moment you see a ship sinking at sea, a captain going down with her ship.

Then you hear a voice, soft 'It is too late, he knows.. he watches..i cannot...fight him... find.... my... sister'

The voice begins to fade 'too late... '

While you each have seen and heard different things within this dream, when pain lances through your head and you each awaken in a cold sweat, you have the memories from each others different perspective.
