# House Galawin
Livery: Light green/teal

We encountered a defeated group on the road in [[Bandits-Way|Bandit's Way]] in [[Session-2]], they had been attacked by gnolls. They had been travelling to [[Mayhearth]] with a barrel of spices, and a magically locked chest (opened in [[Session-2]]).

Rivals of the ruling house [[House-Brannigan|House Brannigan]].
