# Quests & Questions
## Loose Ends
Halward  
- I don't think we ever asked what he meant by "There have been developments since we left"
- Halward said he warned Rhett about travelling, but Rhett managed to make it back to Copperhead despite the harsh winter weather, did he take a special route?
- Offered to show us his notes

Aliyah
- Why is Aliyah looking into the Crimson Grin?
- Why did she ask if any of us were sent ot WF to look for someone? Is there someone she is concerned about?

What were the messages carried by the [[Sir Fared Dalan, Royal Messenger|Royal Messenger]]?  
- One for Lady Aliyah
- One for the Mayor

The sword from Sir Ferro seems magical, it is also [[Session-7#^9467f3|flavourless]].

## Questions
### Thieves in the night
- Who or what is stealing rations from our camp at night?
	- See: [[Blinkdogs]]

### Sir Ferro's belongings
#### The infernal book & the gemstones
We recovered a magical chest from [[Bandits-Way|Bandit's Way]] in [[Session-2]], it contained a book written in infernal and a set of gemstones.  
- What is the book?
- How are the gemstones and the book connected?

#### The barrel of spices
Sold to the owner of the Miner's Rest in [[Copperhead]].  
We know that spices are sourced from the [[Vezoca-Dynasty]], another human empire that have their eyes on Cruidan.  
Why did Ferro have these spices? Is there something nefarious at play with [[House-Galawin]]?

### The fate of Quick Rhett
When we stole the [[Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge|map to the arcane forge]] from Rhett's home in Copperhead, Shed picked up a coded letter implying Rhett has a debt to [[The-Crimson-Grin|The Grin]].
- We could assume that Rhett was going to hunt the treasure to pay off his debt. What happens to him now?
