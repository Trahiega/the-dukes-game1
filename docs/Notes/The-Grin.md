# The Grin
The [[Coded Letter for Quick Rhett]] seems to be from a group called The Grin.

Rhett owes them money, and the writer of the letter "C.G." threatens to visit "the red smile" upon Rhett if him or C.G.s two associates do nto resolve Rhetts debt.

The two associates could be Vorian and Randall, as they were set to guard the map in Rhett's house and both have a tattoo of a red grinning mouth.

### Known Members
