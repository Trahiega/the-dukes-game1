[[Ozmir]] had a strange dream.

A meteor falls from the sky leaving a huge crater.

I am hovering near the centre of the crate, clad in purple & silver robes.

Several objects swirl in the crater just out of reach.

- A band of silver etched with phases of the moon - Perhaps the [[Moonlit Crown]].
- a suit of armour on fire
- a shield with an angry face shouting but silent
- a cloak with scales of melting ice
- a white banner, edged in black, stained with blood - The banner of the [[Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck]].
