# The Crimson Grin
[[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] is investigating the grin.

They have been linked to the murder of an investigator.

Assassin's attacked the party in [[Winterfield]] after their meeting with Lady Aliyah in [[Session-8]]

### The Grin & Quick Rhett
The [[Coded Letter for Quick Rhett]] seems to be from a group called The Grin.

[[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] owes them money, and the writer of the letter "C.G." threatens to visit "the red smile" upon [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]] if him or C.G.s two associates do not resolve [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]]'s debt.

The two associates could be Vorian and Randall, as they were set to guard the map in [[Quick-Rhett|Rhett]]'s house and both have a tattoo of a red grinning mouth.
