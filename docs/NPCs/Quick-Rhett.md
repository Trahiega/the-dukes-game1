Halward discovered Rhett had the map as he was in Winterfield bragging about having it. Despite [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]] describing Rhett as a thief, when we asked around Copperhead about him he seemed to be well respected.

The party have never met Rhett, but [[Vorian]] informed us that Rhett was currently in [[Mayhearth]], in [[Session-4]].

Rhett is a short human, boastful and a thief.
