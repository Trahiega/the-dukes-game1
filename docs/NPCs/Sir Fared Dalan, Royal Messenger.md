# Sir Fared Dalan, Royal Messenger
We met the Royal Messenger in [[Session-6]] when he was travelling through the [[Bandits-Way]] to [[Winterfield]] with a message for [[Lady-Aliyah]], and their group was ambushed by Orcs.

He offered us 2 good horses to join them on their travels.


#### Appearance
Fancy blue & white robes
