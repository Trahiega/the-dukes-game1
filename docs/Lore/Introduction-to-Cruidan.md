# Introduction To Cruidan
The land of [[Cruidan]] has been ravaged by the [[Great Plague]], the very land withering and dying. It has been assaulted and taken by the [[Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck]], and then reclaimed after the Tar Ugruck were defeated by armies lead by the Paladin of Tyr named [[Krahan]].

Threats from the south, lands thought lost and inhabitable due to the time of the plague and the collapse caused by the Orcs revealed a new threat, the [[Vezoca-Dynasty]] another Human empire intent on conquering richer lands. Aggressive and driven by blind loyalty to their Emperor, its people wish to force the people of Cruidan to bow to their Dynasty, through any means possible.

[[The-Kingdom-of-Krahan]], formed in [[Krahan]]'s honour after he brought the people of Cruidan together to drive back the Tar Ugruck. Though they are still at war with the Tar Ugruck, they have spent many years rebuilding, new fortifications, the new city of [[Mayhearth]], and many new smaller settlements. Very few buildings remain from the time before the great plague. [[Krahan]]'s [[Paladins-of-Tyr]] and [[Knights-of-Krahan]] are famous throughout the land, and yearly summer crusades are launched against the Tar Ugruck. 

[[The-League-of-Prosperity]]: Many of the fractured Gnome and Halfing society's, as well as many others with a mind for progress and trade, formed the League with an agreement that its Cities would remain outside of the law and government of others, and would remain neutral and peaceful, intent only on the prosperity of the land, and themselves.

[[The Grey Order]] in the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society.

It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of [[Eyith]], the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from [[Krahan]] have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the [[Stormy Swells]]. 

Magic is considered just another element of nature within the world to be harnessed like anything else. Though people who practice it are looked on with much suspicion by the general people and experimentation with magic is punishable by law. Divine magic comes from the many gods, who have their own machinations on the world, their own power is limited within this plane, instead they prefer to grant magic to their worshippers in exchange for having their will carried out, though since the great plague the gods have been silent, no word or sign besides Divine magic still working has been heard or seen.

The land has become wild, the very trees and plants becoming aggressive as they fight for fertile soil, different species popping up and dying. The surviving beasts and other creatures of the land, the strong or those that have adapted, have made large areas dangerous. Even within the borders of the kingdoms there have been reports of strange beasts and animal attacks.

Things to note This is written from the perspective of a member of the kingdom of [[Krahan]], which is where you will be starting your adventure. Remember that History is not always as it seems, “History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon"
